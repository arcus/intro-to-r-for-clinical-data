# Quarto Slides

This directory holds the source code for the slide decks used in the Introduction to R for Clinical Data workshop, co-presented by Arcus Education and the R User Group of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.

These slides can be published using the `quarto publish` command, executed in the command line / terminal, *not* in the R console.
